# my-portfolio

## Description

Web application featuring my portfolio. It aggregates information about me and my career path and some of my latest web dev projects.

## Motivation

The aim is twofold. First, the app aggregates in one place relevant resources and materials about my personality and makes them easily accessible to other professionals and/or potential employers. Secondly, the app was one of my first small coding projects on which I practiced the use of HTML and CSS.

## What I learned

While working on the app, I could experience the remarkable differecnce between coding an app like this from scratch versus using a CSS framework like Bootstrap or others. Despite more time consuming and error prone, it was a very enjoyable project. My plan for the future is to build my portfolio website again, this time using a CSS framework.
